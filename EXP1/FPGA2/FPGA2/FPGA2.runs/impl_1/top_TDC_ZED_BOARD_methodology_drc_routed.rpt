There is a large setup violation of -23.069 ns between tdc_decode/tdc_input_buf_reg_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk) and tdc_decode/dec_reg_reg[5]/D (clocked by clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#60 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -23.752 ns between tdc_decode/tdc_input_buf_reg_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk) and tdc_decode/dec_reg_reg[6]/D (clocked by clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
